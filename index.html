                        I am a senior at Arizona State University studying Computer Science expecting to graduate in May 2018.
                        I current am working as an iOS Developer with Starbucks create and maintain features for the iOS application.
                        Previously I was employed a Big Data Intern with Western Digital where I worked with machine learning algorithms, Spark, Flask, Hive and many other technologies.
                        I have also taken part in creating SWHacks as the Food Coordinator where I was in charge of all food related tasks. 
                        I am interested in building new and interesting products, and always looking for new technologies to learn about.

                    I am currently working as an iOS Development Intern with Starbuck. I have worked on features such as a randomizer game that allowed users to get a random item by interacting with a slot machine. 
                    As well as work on maintaining already existing features. 
                    With starbucks I have gained experience working with mobile application using Swift and working with a large team of developers in an Agile enviroment.

                    During summer of 2017 I worked with the Big Data Platform at Western Digital, using Spark, AWS, 
                    and machine learning algorithms to better analyize data.
                    During my time at Western Digital I created a One Time Secret Instance and a URL Shortener web application to allow for easy and secure sharing for others within the company.
                    I have also gained exposure to database technologies such as Redis, Hive, Impala and Hadoop, and used Jenkins, Maven, and Ansible, to deploy completed projects.

                    I gained valuable communication skills by break down complex and technical consepts so that they were easy to understand 
                    for people without a technical background. 
                    Learned how to use Git/Github in order to properly manage curriculum.

                        <h3>Amazon Alexa Interview Prep</h3>
                        <p>
                            As a group of four people we created an Amazon Alexa skill that allows for students to prepare for interviews by completing mock interviews with our skill.
                            We wanted to create something that would be impactful to ourselves and peers and solve relevant issues.
                            In this project we used Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a front end were users can find recordings of past mock interviews and review their work 
                            and gain insight to their proformance.
                            We emphasized the exclusion of a UI during the interview to ensure a realistic and immersive experience for the user.
